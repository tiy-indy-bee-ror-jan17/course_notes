# Welcome
I hope you all are as excited as I am about getting this class started. It is in the best interest of everyone to make sure you as prepared as possible for the coming twelve weeks. Through large amounts of hard work and determination, you will learn, grow, and achieve.

Hopefully, we'll also have a bit of fun along the way as well.

Remember, we are all in this together. We will have individual assignments and group assignments. Always be willing and ready to help your peers.

Thank you for your commitment and hard work. It will be rewarded.

There are quite a few tasks and topics that are necessary to take care of before we can actually start learning how to be Ruby and Rails developers. Rather than using class time to get through these, I expect that you can accomplish and learn these things without assistance so that we can spend class time only on those things that are difficult to learn on your own. If you have any questions or confusion about these tasks, please [email me](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com) so I can help you work through them.

## The elephant in the room

This course is _immersive_ and our best students have been the ones that commit themselves to it as fully as possible.

So, in this time before the course, do what you can to clear the decks, so to speak.

Think of this course as a very intense, 12-week job with copious overtime. Our best students make this their _life_ for 12 weeks so they can have the life they want afterward.

There's always time to catch up on Game of Thrones later.

## Class policies

Before class starts, I also encourage you to review the [class_policies.md](class_policies.md) so everyone's expectations are aligned for the start of the course.

## Objectives
The following are the learning objectives for this prework, all of which are important requirements expected of a professional developer. Though they are not technically “programming” skills, they are crucially important to success both during the class and on the job.

1. Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in writing.
2. Be able to learn in contexts that aren’t necessarily suited to your primary learning style.
3. Adapt to the workflows used by professional developers (using the command line in particular)
4. Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one’s own type of mindset.

## Mindset
1. Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
2. Compose an [email to me (Chris)](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com) answering the following questions:
- What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? Where do you see the most Growth?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

## Practical Advice

One of the best ways to know what you're in for is to hear from past TIY students about their experiences.

Here's Matt Fair (a graduate from our second cohort here in Indianapolis) talking about his 12 weeks:

## Computer Setup

### Install OSX Sierra, if you haven’t already

_If you recently purchased a Mac, you likely have this already._

1.	You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
2.	Download the El Capitan upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12).
3.	Double-click "Install OS X Sierra” to begin installation.
WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Additional Software
* Install Atom
  * [Download Atom](https://atom.io), a code-editor
  * Install (Note: Make sure you move the application from your Downloads folder to your Applications folder) and run it.
* Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)


## Ruby
If you haven’t completed it already, Codecademy has a Ruby course that you should walk through to familiarize yourself with the concepts.

<http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby>

## HTML & CSS
HTML/CSS will be covered in the course, but not to the same depth as Ruby and Rails, so it would benefit you extremely to be familiar with building websites.

<http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web>

## JavaScript

The last few weeks of the course we'll be delving in JavaScript. Take the time to get a bit familiar.

<https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript>

## The Command Line
The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

1. Read <http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/>
2. <http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics>
3. <http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/>
4. Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li…)

In case you're not sure how to get to the command line on your Mac, here's a hint: There's an application called "Terminal" buried in the "Utilities" folder inside the "Applications" folder ...

Or do a Spotlight search for it. That's likely easier.

## git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable.

### Supplemental
If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based hosting and communication service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at <https://github.com/>
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.
3. Email me ([chris.vannoy@theironyard.com](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com)) the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class.
4. Complete <https://try.github.io/>

### Supplemental
Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.

## Links & Articles to read up on

I'm collecting various blog posts, videos and other links that I'd encourage you to review before class starts.

You can find them over on [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:chris_vannoy/t:jan_2017_cohort/)

## Extra handy resources

Of note: This entire section is completely optional. I'm not expecting you to know or do all of this. After all, that's what class is for.

### Books

First, a quick note on programming books:

They can get out of date _very_ quickly. For instance, one of the books listed below covers Ruby 2.1, while we'll be using Ruby 2.3 in class. There are not hugely impactful differences between the two, but it's something to keep in mind.

Both books are intended more to help guide _thinking_ about Ruby and programming in general than any specific syntax.

* **[Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431654647&sr=8-1&keywords=eloquent+ruby):** Great, quick read that covers Ruby from beginning to end with a focus more on thinking like a Rubyist.
* **[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431660063&sr=8-1&keywords=well-grounded+rubyist):** A bit deeper than "Eloquent," but a similar back-to-front look at Ruby.

#### A special recommendation

Past cohorts have really found [Ruby Wizardry](https://www.nostarch.com/rubywizardry), a book intended to introduce programming to children, really useful - especially for the first two weeks of Ruby.

If you think taking in an alternative (and fun!) look at the Ruby language itself, I can recommend it based on past students' experiences.

### Tangential subjects

These following subjects we'll cover either deeply in class or will touch on only a little (Markdown in particular will be covered very lightly if at all). That said, it never hurts to get familiar - even if it might not make sense just yet.

* **[GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)**
* **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)**
* **[jQuery](https://jquery.com)**
* **[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)**
* **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)**
* **[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)**
* **[SQL](http://www.sqlteaching.com)**

### Videos

If you want to get a better idea of the Ruby (and Rails specifically) community, RailsConf does a great job posting their talk videos.

Here's a huge list of the [2015 conference talks](http://confreaks.tv/events/railsconf2015). And the [2016 talks](http://confreaks.tv/events/railsconf2016) are up as well.

### Local Indy Community

I've been part of the Ruby community here in Indianapolis since the very beginning and it's been fun to watch it blossom over the years.

For your purposes, you can start getting involved now if you'd like.

There's a well-attended (and friendly!) [monthly meetup](http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/), and associated IRC and [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/invitations/94a1bf817fd42ec852f693da30f685ddccb57a7c) groups. The group's [website](http://indyrb.org) has more information.

The Rubyist community here in Indy is truly great and you're going to enjoy being a part of it.

## Closing

As I mentioned at the top (and goodness, that seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?), I'm really looking forward to working with you in this class.

I'd like to reiterate one key point:

For these 12 short weeks, we're all in this together. Our goal as a class should be to make each other better and give freely of our knowledge to help others succeed. That's, of course, my primary goal, but this class will really hum if we're all rowing together.

And I have high hopes that we will be.

See you in September!

I can't wait.
